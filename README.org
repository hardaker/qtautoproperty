AUTO PROPERTIES for Qt

* What qtautoproperty does

  This tool lets you write simple macros like this into your header
  Qt files:

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
    // QTAUTO_GET_SET_SIGNAL(int, myIntProperty)
#+END_SRC

  The tool, when run, will then add the appropriate get/set/signals to
  the header file as inline code for your header file.  This prevents
  you from having to manually type things like:

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
  Q_PROPERTY(int myIntProperty READ myIntProperty WRITE setMyIntProperity NOTIFY myIntPropertyChanged);
  public:
     const int &myIntProperty() const { return m_myIntProperty; }

  signals:
     void myIntPropertyChanged();

  public slots:
     void setMyIntProperity(const int &newval) { 
        if (newval != m_myIntProperty) {
           m_myIntProperty = newval;
           emit myIntPropertyChanged();
        }
     }

  private:

    int m_myIntProperty;
#+END_SRC

  Which is actually what the output produces. though you can customize
  it by changing the qt_auto_properties.h file.  But when it replaces it
  in your file, it'll be on a single (smashed-together) line.

* Options

  You can add a line such as:

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
    // QTAUTO_HERE
#+END_SRC c++

  And the resulting output will be placed below that line.

* Usage

  To make use of it, copy the qt_auto_properties.h file into your source
  directory and then simply run qtautoproperty on the header file and it
  should modify the header file appropriately.  Unless you follow the
  instructions in the next section, you'll need to have your macros
  commented out using // in front of them.

  You can set up qtcreator
  to call the tool automatically for a given file using a setup like
  this in the /Tools->External->Configure/ settings:

*** Using inline macros instead of commented macros

    You can make use of inline macros instead of commented out macros,
    simply include the qt_auto_properties.h file into your header file
    and the macros will no longer trigger compiler errors as they'll
    be instantiated as empty defines.

*** Available Macros
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
    QTAUTO_GET(type, varname)            // defines just the varname() function

    QTAUTO_GET_SIGNAL(type, varname)     // same but all defines a signal
                                       // (but you must emit it!!)

    QTAUTO_GET_SET_SIGNAL(type, varname) // defines setVarname() too
                                       // and emits the signal
#+END_SRC c++

*** Turning on extra debugging output

    If you define QTAUTO_DEBUG_SIGNALS_SLOTS and rebuild everything,
    every time a value is changed in an property a debugging message
    will be printed (using qDebug()), such as:

       setting new value for  varName   true  =>  false 

    To turn it on within your .pro file, use this:

       DEFINES += QTAUTO_DEBUG_SIGNALS_SLOTS
